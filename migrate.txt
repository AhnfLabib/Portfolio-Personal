### Markdown prompt for rebuilding the site with Next.js, Tailwind, shadcn/ui

Build me a modern, accessible, and responsive personal website using Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. Preserve all body text content and section structure from my current site. Use clean, componentized architecture with server components by default and client components only where needed.

- Tech stack: Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, eslint/prettier, lucide-react, next-seo.
- Design: Minimal dark-first theme with tasteful glass/blur overlays and soft glow accents. Smooth scroll, subtle section reveals, and a light background animation are welcome but keep perf high.
- Accessibility: Keyboard nav, focus states, semantic HTML, aria labels where appropriate.
- SEO: Metadata, OpenGraph, Twitter cards, sitemap, robots, good headings structure.
- Performance: Optimize images with `next/image`, prefetch main nav links, avoid heavy client JS.

Project initialization
- Initialize a Next.js app with TypeScript and Tailwind configured.
- Install shadcn/ui and configure components directory.
- Add `next-seo` for SEO configuration and defaults.
- Set up base theme (dark default) with ability to support light if toggled in the future.
- Create `public/` assets mapped from my current images:
  - `AL logo.png` (favicon + navbar logo), `ahnafLabib.png`, `depauw-logo.png`, `idtech-logo.png`, `CDI.png`, `HDSTRT.png`, `TNZR.png`, `du.png`, `GDSC.svg`, `nexevent.png`, `page-friend.png`, `Iot.png`, `simple.png`, `ToDoList.png`, `weatherbuddy.png`.
- Use `next/font` for fonts similar to Poppins and a serif accent if needed.

Site architecture (App Router)
- Pages/Routes:
  - `/` (single-page layout with anchored sections): hero, about, education, experience, leadership, projects, contact, quote, footer.
- Global layout:
  - Sticky translucent navbar with logo and anchors: About, Education, Experience, Leadership, Projects, Contact.
  - Background layer supports a subtle animated gradient or blurred circles, behind content.
  - Container width ~max-w-[1200px], generous vertical spacing.
- Components (shadcn mapping where helpful):
  - `Navbar` (uses shadcn `navigation-menu` or custom): responsive menu button on mobile; active link highlight on scroll.
  - `Hero` with typed text effect, CTA button to Contact, subtle scroll indicator.
  - `Section` wrapper with reveal-on-scroll animation (IntersectionObserver) and consistent paddings.
  - `About` with photo on right (desktop), text on left; stacks on mobile.
  - `Education` as a media/card layout.
  - `Experience` as a vertical timeline with company logos and details; left rail line with nodes; card feel for content.
  - `Leadership` as a responsive grid of cards.
  - `Projects` as horizontally scrollable cards with overlay GitHub link on hover; left/right scroll buttons on desktop only.
  - `ContactForm` with shadcn `Input`, `Textarea`, `Button`; submit posts JSON to a Google Apps Script endpoint.
  - `Quote` centered blockquote with author.
  - `Footer` including email, LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram links.
  - Optional `ThemeToggle` reserved slot (can be disabled by default).
- Animations:
  - Section fade/slide in when entering viewport.
  - Hero title initial motion and typing cursor blink.
  - Projects card hover lift and overlay reveal.
  - Keep animations lightweight; prefer CSS and IntersectionObserver.

UI/UX requirements
- Typography:
  - Use `next/font` to load a geometric sans (e.g., Inter or Poppins-like) and optionally a serif accent.
  - Hero H1 large and bold, highlight ‚ÄúAhnaf Labib‚Äù in a soft yellow accent with glow.
- Colors:
  - Dark background (#000‚Äì#1A1A1A range), primary text as white/near-white.
  - Accents: yellow highlight (#FFE87C-ish), secondary blues/purples for interactive states.
- Components and utility:
  - Prefer shadcn/ui building blocks for `button`, `input`, `textarea`, `card`, `navigation-menu`, `toaster`.
  - Use Tailwind for layout, spacing, responsive behavior, and custom utilities.
- Motion:
  - Keep transitions subtle (200‚Äì300ms), reduce motion for `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Responsiveness:
  - Navbar collapses to a menu button under 768px.
  - About stacks image under text on mobile and centers.
  - Projects scroll buttons hidden on mobile; horizontal scroll via swipe/wheel remains.

Implementation details
- File structure (example):
  - `app/layout.tsx`, `app/page.tsx`
  - `components/navbar.tsx`, `components/hero.tsx`, `components/section.tsx`, `components/about.tsx`, `components/education.tsx`, `components/experience.tsx`, `components/leadership.tsx`, `components/projects.tsx`, `components/contact-form.tsx`, `components/quote.tsx`, `components/footer.tsx`, `components/scroll-indicator.tsx`, `components/typed-text.tsx` (client)
  - `components/ui/*` from shadcn generator
  - `lib/seo.ts`, `lib/sections.ts` (ids and anchor map), `lib/constants.ts` (typed words array)
  - `public/*` for all assets
- Reusable `Section` component:
  - Accepts `id`, `title`, `children`.
  - Applies consistent paddings and handles reveal-on-scroll (client).
- Typed text:
  - Client component with the provided words array; configurable speeds; blinking cursor.
- Projects:
  - Use `next/image`; overlay GitHub button with `Button` variant=outline; keyboard-accessible.
- Experience timeline:
  - Semantic list; left line and nodes with CSS; card content with logo, role, company, duration, description.
- Contact:
  - Edge function or server action optional; for now POST directly to the given Apps Script URL with `fetch` from client and JSON body.
- Navbar active state:
  - IntersectionObserver to set current section; visually indicate active anchor.
- Smooth scrolling:
  - Use CSS `scroll-behavior: smooth` and `scroll-margin-top` on sections to account for sticky navbar.

Tailwind and shadcn setup
- Tailwind config:
  - Add container center, custom colors for accent yellow and secondary blue/purple, safe area paddings, and animation utilities for fade/slide.
- shadcn:
  - Install `button`, `input`, `textarea`, `card`, `navigation-menu`, `sonner` or `toast`.

Accessibility and semantics
- Proper headings hierarchy: H1 in hero, H2 for section titles.
- Anchor nav labels with `aria-current="page"` when active.
- Form labels and `aria-invalid` where necessary.
- Sufficient contrast for text and focus outlines.

SEO
- Use `Metadata` API and `next-seo` defaults:
  - Title: ‚ÄúAhnaf | Portfolio‚Äù
  - Description summarizing About section
  - Favicon from `AL logo.png`
  - OpenGraph image derived from hero photo/name or a generated image
  - Robots allow indexing
- Add `/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt`.

Acceptance criteria
- All body text, names, roles, durations, descriptions, links, and quote match the current content exactly.
- Design feels modern and refined with dark-first styling and subtle motion.
- Good Lighthouse scores (A11y 95+, Best Practices 95+, SEO 95+, Performance as high as feasible).
- The navigation works smoothly with active section highlighting, and all external links open in new tabs.
- Contact form submits JSON to the specified URL and shows success/error toasts.

Deliverables
- A Next.js project ready to run: `npm i && npm run dev`
- README with setup instructions and where to place images in `public/`.
- All images referenced correctly and optimized with `next/image`.

I‚Äôm ready to scaffold this in your repo next if you‚Äôd like me to generate the app, configure Tailwind/shadcn, and migrate all content.

I extracted your site‚Äôs sections and text and produced a drop-in prompt/spec to rebuild it with Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn/ui, preserving all content and behavior.
